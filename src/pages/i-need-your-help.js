        <p className="intro">Hello friend,</p>
        <p className="intro">
          It's Wednesday, September 11th. I'm reaching out to you personally as I consider you someone who has inspired
          me in the past or just someone I genuinely look up to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Iâ€™m currently in Mombasa, Kenya during the 4th and final week of volunteering at a local NGO, SwahiliBox.
          </strong>{' '}
          For the past month, along with 2 colleagues of mine, we've been running various technical workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Yesterday</strong>, I've announced that I can run one more workshop this week, asking about the topic
          they would like me to cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          To my excitement, they've mentioned that{' '}
          <strong>they'd love to cover entrepreneurship and soft skills</strong>. I couldn't be happier about that!
          However, I then realized that after 3 weeks spent with them, distributing this process could both produce
          better results in terms of diversifying ideas, but also have a bigger impact that should hopefully push them
          to act more boldly :)
        </p>

        <h2>The idea</h2>

        <p style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
          <strong>
            I'd like to create a compilation of short videos encouraging Swahilibox members to take action while keeping
            focused on their goals and thinking big.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, a video should include at least one tip connected to:{' '}
          <strong>
            community leadership, networking, being searchable, understanding how to self-direct their growth, improving
            soft skills, validating business ideas, not being afraid to fail, etc.
          </strong>{' '}
          (Anything that would boost their careers other than technical skills, really.)
        </p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>start with "hello swahilibox!"</li>
          <li>please don't mention me at all</li>
          <li>
            feel free to refer to your past experiences (explain how TAKING ACTION resulted in a very tangible and
            positive outcome)
          </li>
          <li>as for the duration, anything between 5 seconds and 5 minutes works</li>
          <li>horizontal orientation is strongly preferred, but not required</li>
          <li>feel free to forward to your friends if they'd like to contribute as well!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Target group</h2>
        <p>
          SwahiliBox currently consists of about 15 talented developers, mostly between 18-26 years old. Some are good
          with IoT, others already published native mobile apps, but the biggest group is eager to keep getting better
          at web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are some of the members who stand out from the crowd, I think by referencing them personally we could
          have a bigger impact.

            they are making a small gadget that will allow for faster communication to health workers when a pregnant
            mother is in need of medical help.
