    <p>Howdy. I am a front-end engineer based in Kraków, Poland.</p>

    <p>
      I specialize in JavaScript, web accessibility and user experience engineering. I’ve started the Kraków office of
      Xfive.co. I currently work with X-Team.com.

    <p>
      Typography (especially vintage book covers) is my obsession. I sometimes pretend to be a public speaker. Other
      times I take photos with Instax or my phone.
